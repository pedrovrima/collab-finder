I enabled `--info` level logging on the gradle command on our CI and noticed that `> Task :app:copyPlaystoreReleaseBundledJs NO-SOURCE` was there with the info that the source file didn't exist. This led me to believe that the `copyXXXBundledJs` task and `bundleXXXJsAndAssets` tasks were not executing in the proper order.\r\n\r\nStrangely, this issue only started to occur for us after updating a dependency on Android, but I suspect it's always been a race condition and we've just gotten lucky.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that the `bundleJsAndAssets` task runs before the `copyBundledJs` task.\r\n\r\nI've tested locally with our code and also on our CI and both are finally working 💪 \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n[Android] [Fixed] - Ensure gradle task order (`bundleJsAndAssets` occurs before `copyBundledJs`)\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\n\r\n`./gradlew clean && ./gradlew cleanBuildCache && ./gradle bundleFlavourRelease`\r\n\r\nThe generated bundle now includes `index.android.bundle` (of course this is difficult to test, because the issue only happens on some machines/setups/when the stars align, apparently).\r\n"

What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a few issues with the Appearance API (as noted here https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/28823).\r\n\r\n1. For the Appearance API to work correctly on Android you need to call `AppearanceModule.onConfigurationChanged` when the current Activity goes through a configuration change. This was being called in the RNTester app but not in `ReactActivity` so it meant the Appearance API wouldn't work for Android in newly generated RN projects (or ones upgraded to the latest version of RN).\r\n\r\n2. The Appearance API wasn't working correctly for brownfield scenarios on Android. It's possible to force an app light or dark natively on Android by calling `AppCompatDelegate.setDefaultNightMode()`. The Appearance API wasn't picking up changes from this function because it was using the Application context instead of the current Activity context.\r\n\r\n3. The Appearance API wasn't working correctly for brownfield scenarios on iOS. Just like on Android its possible to force an app light or dark natively by setting `window.overrideUserInterfaceStyle`.

When a child view is outside of the parent view's boundaries, it's visible on Android, but not tappable. This behaviour is incorrect, and doesn't match iOS behaviour.\r\n\r\n- Taps on Views outside the bounds of a parent with `overflow: visible` (or unset) should register\r\n- Taps on Views outside the bounds of a parent with `overflow: hidden` (or unset) should continue to not register\r\n\r\n### Why #26374 doesn't fix this for some cases\r\n\r\nWhile #26374 fixed the issue on elements within the bounds of a parent with `overflow: visible`, it didn't fix the issue in a specific case I found where there were 3 nested views:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2937410/83611565-004bb500-a536-11ea-8450-3baeb9867c77.png)\r\n\r\nIn the `findTouchTargetView` for View 1, it would see the touch is outside of View 2 and not traverse deeper. This fix avoids that pitfall by continuing to traverse not only when `overflow` is visible, but in all cases. It then only does the bounds check later.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\n- Made `findTouchTargetView` not check that the touch was in the bounds of the immediate children, but instead\r\n  - Check that the touch is in its own bounds when returning itself\r\n  - Check that the touch for a child is in its own bounds only when `overflow: hidden` is set\r\n- Modified related code to adjust to this change\r\n- Added RNTesterApp test\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.

In my case, I was using a `ph://` photo/asset library URL, which gets handled by [`RCTAssetsLibraryRequestHandler`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/aee88b6843cea63d6aa0b5879ad6ef9da4701846/Libraries/CameraRoll/RCTAssetsLibraryRequestHandler.mm#L131). In this case, even though the request was sent from a background thread, the result seems to always be [returned on the main thread](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phimagemanager/1616957-requestimagedataforasset?language=objc)\r\n4. **Thread 2**: After completing the request:\r\n   - [`RCTAssetsLibraryRequestHandler` will call](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/1f95c9b62e306fdaf0ef351b02fb79713941259c/Libraries/CameraRoll/RCTAssetsLibraryRequestHandler.mm#L156) `NetworkTask`'s [`(void)URLRequest:(id)requestToken didCompleteWithError:(NSError *)error`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/1f95c9b62e306fdaf0ef351b02fb79713941259c/Libraries/Network/RCTNetworkTask.mm#L194)\r\n   - Which sets the status to `RCTNetworkTaskFinished`\r\n   - AND then calls [`NetworkTask`'s `invalidate`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/1f95c9b62e306fdaf0ef351b02fb79713941259c/Libraries/Network/RCTNetworkTask.mm#L48)\r\n   - Which sets the `_requestToken` to `nil`\r\n5. **Thread 1**: Some time later, the thread resumes, and [sets the status to `RCTNetworkTaskInProgress`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/aee88b6843cea63d6aa0b5879ad6ef9da4701846/Libraries/Network/RCTNetworkTask.mm#L79), even though it's actually already finished!\r\n6. **Thread 1**: Later on, when the ImageLoader iterates through the network tasks again, it finds the odd case where there's [no `requestToken` yet it's marked as in progress](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/1f95c9b62e306fdaf0ef351b02fb79713941259c/Libraries/Image/RCTImageLoader.mm#L366).\r\n\r\nThis may address some, but not all causes of https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/12152\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n[iOS] [Fixed] - Fix race conditions in NetworkTask that caused ImageLoader to report Task Orphaned\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nTested using `RNTester`; also, verified that the warning messages for \"Task orphaned\" no longer appear in test app\r\n"

Several of these test pages and some of the existing integration tests suffer intermittent failures due to unfinished RCTImageLoader tasks when the test loader deallocs.  \r\n\r\nThe `RNTesterLoadAllPages` is an `XCTestCase` sublcass that overrides the `defaultTestSuite` class method. In this method it run uses the `RCTTestRunner` to run a new JavaScript \"test\" in `RNTester.ios.js` called `EnumerateExamplePages`. This JavaScript test simply writes to console the key names of each test page in the `RNTesterList.ios.js` map.  In `defaultTestSuite` a bridge log block function captures the console and builds up an array of the test names. It creates an `XCTestCase` for each test and returns the tests. This method for dynamically creating the tests at runtime was borrowed from GTMGoogleTestRunner.\r\n\r\nWhen each dynamically created `XCTestCase` is executed, it's selector IMP also uses `RCTTestRunner` to run an RNTester test named `\"LoadPageTest_<key>\"`. In `RNTesterApp.ios.js` instances of a new component LoadPageTest is created for each RNTester page and registered using the scheme `\"LoadPageTest_<key>\"` in a way similar to how the existing Snapshot tests are registered.\r\n\r\nSome RNTester pages cannot be tested in this manner: some pages require native modules that only function in the full RNTester app (these pages have their own dedicated integration test code), don't function in the iOS Simulator, or have other issues. A new skipTest key is added the `RNTesterTypes` to allow individual tests to be skipped by providing a \"reason\" string.\r\n\r\n`RCTImageLoader` is modified to expose a `activeTasks` readonly property that returns the value of the `_activeTasks` ivar.   `RCTTestRunnder`'s while loop that waits for the test to complete is modified to wait until activeTasks to be zero.\r\n\r\nThis contribution was implemented in the https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos fork and has proven to be very useful in catching regressions in RNTester examples and in the general reliability of the iOS and macOS integration tests.  https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos/issues/368\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n[iOS] [Fixed] - Add a test that loads all RNTester pages and improve reliability of RCTTestRunner\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nRan RNTester integration tests locally."

The method clipPath does not correctly crop Views with overflow:hidden and LAYER_TYPE_NONE if the parent View has rounded border and transform rotate.  The View is cropped without considering the transform rotate effect. Additional information are available on the discussion https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/18266. Ramanpreet Nara (RSNara) contributed to solve this issue implementing rounded borders functionality in https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/4994d6a389b4e41ba25e802edab5d3fdc9e8a4f1.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n[Android] [Fixed] - Fix overflow hidden with transform rotate on a View with borderRadius\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nThe solution uses [`setLayerType`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setLayerType(int,%20android.graphics.Paint)) to change the layer to [`LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE). `setLayerType` specifies the type of layer backing this view. \r\n\r\nThe change is applied only to Views with overflow hidden running on sdk 24-28.\r\n\r\nThe below screenshots are from `RNTester` transformation examples. \r\n\r\nThe screenshot on the left displays how the `clipPath` method crops incorrectly using a `Path` shape without the `transform: { rotate: \"30deg\" }` effect. The `View` is cropped as if no rotation was applied. The screenshot on the right displays the result after implementing the patch.\r\n\r\n| **BEFORE** | **AFTER** | \r\n|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\r\n| <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24992535/81710487-0be61780-9473-11ea-9365-5b5aa5b29360.png\" data-canonical-src=\"https://gyazo.com/eb5c5741b6a9a16c692170a41a49c858.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"\" /> | <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24992535/81710479-0ab4ea80-9473-11ea-8d3c-204e668c7359.png\"  width=\"200\" height=\"\" /> |\r\n\r\nThe below tests performed with `RNTester` Animated examples do not identify any issue when running animations.

This happens only when they're inside of FlatLists that are rendered with `removeClippedSubview` prop set to true on Android.\r\n\r\nFixes #27787\r\n\r\nIssue #6085 2 years ago had fixed this issue with a quick fix, but the code has since disappeared in another change. It has a longer explanation for why it's fixed, but essentially - the text is assumed to be not selectable since the TextInput is initialized without being attached to the window. We need to explicitly set the text to be selectable on attachment. This change redoes that change with a 1-line fix.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n<!-- Help reviewers and the release process by writing your own changelog entry.

          "body": "**Note: Code untested, help wanted!**\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nRight now, if you set a [URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) as the body of a XMLHTTPRequest, it is silently dropped. Support for this feature [is in the whatwg fetch spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/send) and currently supported in browsers.\r\n\r\n## react-native's Code\r\n\r\nBefore a request gets sent to native code, the body gets run through [a conversion function which lacks support for URLSearchParams](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Network/convertRequestBody.js).\r\n\r\nSince the body doesn't get converted, it ends up being dropped (silently) in the native code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Nothing in the data payload, at least nothing we could understand anyway.\r\n// Ignore and treat it as if it were null.\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Network/RCTNetworking.mm#L337-L412\r\n\r\n## The Fix\r\n\r\nI see two options here:\r\n\r\n1. [Probably not this one] You could just convert the URLSearchParams, calling `.toString()` and then treating it as if it were a regular string. The diff would be short, but the content-type header would incorrectly default to `text/plain;charset=UTF-8` instead of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8`. External callers could still pass the correct headers (and whatwg-fetch, for example, would in fact take care of that for you).\r\n2. From [convertRequestBody](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Network/convertRequestBody.js), return an object `{ urlSearchParams: body.toString() }` and update [processDataForHTTPQuery](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/eb6001998be697f6e956eec6eb2385ce7572aa39/Libraries/Network/RCTNetworking.mm#L337-L412) to accept this as an input type. \r\n\r\nAs an additional feature, it might be nice to get some sort of warning or error when an unsupported/non-processable object is passed in, instead of silently ignoring it. \r\n\r\n## My Code\r\n\r\nI'm going to be real with you: I don't even know what language a `.mm` file is. I don't have an Apple computer to run the tests on, and I don't even know if this code is also run on Android or there's a separate file for that.\r\n\r\nThat said, I've included my best impression of what this diff should look like.  (Using approach 2.) Would appreciate support from any other contributors.\r\n\r\nEdit: [Is this the corresponding Android code?](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/577fdeaa621ac865b9fbbe6f648c6fab05d0abab/ReactAndroid/src/main/java/com/facebook/react/modules/network/NetworkingModule.java#L363-L388)\r\n\r\n## Workaround for anyone coming in from the internet\r\n\r\nA current workaround found in the wild for this issue seems to be to [call `.toString()` on the URLSearchParams](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35325370/post-a-x-www-form-urlencoded-request-from-react-native#comment92346211_45357307) yourself.\r\n\r\nHowever, I discovered this issue while using an auto-generated API client library and implementing this workaround will be pretty hacky.\r\n\r\n## Reproducible Snack\r\n\r\nHere's a reproducible Snack showing that it is broken on the iOS and Android devices: https://snack.expo.io/z4N9PcIR7\r\n\r\nNote that the snack doesn't work on the web simulator because of CORS restrictions. However, you can check the network tab to see that in web mode, the data is being sent (because web uses the browser's XMLHttpRequest instead of react-native's)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n[General] [Fixed] - Fix body of XMLHttpRequest being dropped when it is a URLSearchParams\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\n\r\n**HELP WANTED HERE**"

Therefore I use webpack 2 and the libraryTarget: umd to register the output under \"OCA.Ocr\" (my library is named \"Ocr\"). This works like intended, but when it comes to the point that I want to use for example underscorejs as a library which will be included in the html later, I cannot get it to work. I followed the webpack configuration documentation and it says that the **externals** configuration option should be the way to go. But if I use it like stated in the documentation, the underscore library in this case is not defined. I also checked, that the library is available in the global namespace and the file gets loaded before my webpack bundle.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n[my webpack.config.js](https://gist.github.com/janis91/919ffabd0829cdbcb6258e619cf5ccc0)\r\n[my typescript code](https://gist.github.com/janis91/8fc9f9b1ce76fc1f2cea74c684e9fdeb)\r\n[webpack bundle](https://gist.github.com/janis91/eb675f17e25eb87159c1e8b62c2a81da)\r\n\r\nFirefox says:\r\n\r\n> TypeError: underscore_1.default is undefined\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub gist. -->\r\n<!-- Best provide a minimal reproduceable repo -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader file the issue on the plugin/loader repo -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo TypeError should be thrown and the underscorejs (`_`) library should be also available for the library bundled with webpacka as an external. (Like stated in the documentation)\r\n\r\n**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**\r\nWebpack Version: 2.5.0\r\nNode: 6.10.2\r\nOS: Debian Jessie\r\nBrowser: Firefox ESR 45.9.0\r\n\r\nAlso related is my [stackoverflow question ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43788304/configuring-library-as-external-in-webpack-does-not-work-with-umd-as-librarytarg)as I actually don't know if this is my fault or if this is a bug.

When I remove the loader the files show up again.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n1. Add dependency to project\r\n2. Add entry file which imports that project\r\n3. Try to create Dll bundle of dependency\r\n\r\n4. Now use a loader on the dependency\r\n5. Check difference of Dll Bundle\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nModules still get added to the bundle, regardless of the loader.\r\n\r\n**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**\r\nWebpack version 2.2.0, node v7, linux (ubuntu).\r\n\r\nI checked the files passed to `LibManifestPlugin` and I noticed that the all the `SingleEntryDependency` on `DllModule` have a `module: null` instead of `module: NormalModule`. I think this is the source of the 'problem'.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to fix this, I just need some more pointers to know where `module` is set on `SingleEntryDependency`.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!

I've tried the different config options for `devtool`:\n- `eval` - works\n- `cheap-eval-source-map` - works\n- `cheap-source-map` - does not work\n- `cheap-module-eval-source-map` - works\n- `cheap-module-source-map` - does not work\n- `eval-source-map` -  works\n- `source-map` - does not work\n\nSo seems like eval is file, but an external sourcemap for multiple files does not.\n\nAny thoughts about what's going on?\n\nI've also filed an issue on Bugzilla, in case this is a FF devtools issue: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1177329\n"

          "body": "Hello,\nI am trying to use `webpack` to bundle a node module, which may later use by an app at client side (so, use webpack again to target the browser environment).\n\nMy node package is simply some reusable react components.To avoid bundling all the dependencies (like `react`), I am following [these 3 posts](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-I) by jlongster. With that, my backend.js file has all the react import is replaced with\n\n```\n `var _react = __webpack_require__(3);` \n```\n\nwhere module 3 is\n\n```\n    /* 3 */\n    /***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n        module.exports = require(\"react\");\n\n    /***/ },\n```\n\nso far everything is good. \n\nNow I am importing above package (Say MyComp) in to a react application.  Webpack builds a bundle, client.js, which has these in it.\n\n1)  in the beginning, from line 1, I have the webpack runtime like\n\n```\n    /******/ (function(modules) { // webpackBootstrap\n```\n\n2)  then the imported `MyComp` also wrapped along with its runtime as\n\n```\n    /* 103 */\n    /***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n        /******/ (function(modules) { // webpackBootstrap\n        /******/    // The module cache\n        /******/    var installedModules = {};\n```\n\n3)  within this second runtime, react is aliased as `var _react = __webpack_require__(3);`\n\n4)  this is resolved to 3 like\n\n```\n/* 3 */\n    /***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n        module.exports = __webpack_require__(11);\n\n    /***/ },\n```\n\n5)  but, 11 within this second runtime is\n\n```\n/* 11 */\n    /***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n        'use strict';\n\n        var React = __webpack_require__(3);\n        var WindowListenable = __webpack_require__(24);\n```\n\nit is not `react` !! . But is `react` outside/main runtime (from the client bundler). \n\nso I get error like\n\n```\n    Uncaught TypeError: React.createClass is not a function\n(anonymous function) @ index.js:8553__webpack_require__ @ index.js:20\n```\n\nso, anyway get rid of the run time if the build target is node, or anything to make the resolution work correctly.\n"

          "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI am not sure if this is a bug or not, but I put it as a feature request, since I didn't find any documentation on this use case...\r\n\r\nThe Controls Addon can infer controls from my React component prop types. For example, having the following Typescript props for a component works well:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface TextProps {\r\n  text: string\r\n  loading: boolean\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis correctly renders a `text` control for the `text` property and a `boolean` control for the `loading` property.\r\n\r\nHowever, let's say I make the props optional (as is the case of most props of React Components):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface TextProps {\r\n  text?: string\r\n  loading?: boolean\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth controls for both properties are now rendered as a raw text input (which strangely is not a control of type `text`). They should be rendered as in the first example.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSolution could be to handle optional properties as if they were not optionals if the component defines a default value for it.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following component:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nexport interface TextProps {\r\n  text?: string\r\n  loading?: boolean\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const TextProps: React.FC<TextProps> = ({ text = '', loading = false }) => {\r\n  //...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSince default values are defined (and are already shown in props table), the controls should act as if `undefined` was not an actual value and display `text` and `boolean` controls for `text` and `loading` properties repectively.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe only solution for me right now is to declare the Story `argTypes` manually for each, which is really not cool, since most Props of all my components are optionals, therefore requiring tedious manual setup in each of my stories."

I would expect this to still be true in 6.x, unless that was an unintended side effect. I confirmed that `parameters` defined on an MDX `Story` component are still available in `storySort` in 6.x.\r\n\r\n**System:**\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 10.15.4\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 13.8.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.0 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.13.7 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 83.0.4103.61\r\n    Firefox: 75.0\r\n    Safari: 13.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @storybook/addon-actions: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/addon-docs: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/addon-knobs: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/addon-storyshots: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/addons: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/react: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/source-loader: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20 \r\n    @storybook/theming: 6.0.0-beta.20 => 6.0.0-beta.20\r\n```\r\n"

This is the behavior if the `docsOnly: true` parameter is removed.  With the parameter active the repeated re-rendering occurs.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nExample screenshot.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-05-28 at 7 01 40 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61430182/83144955-483f8780-a0b1-11ea-8753-c9a7441ccbf4.png)\r\n\r\n**System:**\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS Mojave 10.14.6\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-8950HK CPU @ 2.90GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.19.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.4 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.13.7 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 83.0.4103.61\r\n    Firefox: 76.0.1\r\n    Safari: 13.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe docsOnly parameter was working as expected on prior 6.0 Betas before 15.\r\n"

With 5.3.19, the `fileName` parameter is now a path that is not the module ID.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this was changed in #10539, in order to fix #10519. But the v6 branch doesn't seem to have this change, so perhaps there is some other way to fix search that doesn't break `fileName`?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if the new `fileName` behavior is here to stay, maybe there could be another parameter added to stories with the module ID instead?"

Storybook maintainers cherry-pick bug and documentation fixes into the `master` branch as part of the release process, so you shouldn't need to worry about this.\r\n\r\nMaintainers: Please tag your pull request with at least one of the following:\r\n`[\"cleanup\", \"BREAKING CHANGE\", \"feature request\", \"bug\", \"documentation\", \"maintenance\", \"dependencies\", \"other\"]`\r\n\r\n-->\r\n"
